# AREA_51_PI_SDR
Raspberry Pi 5 SDR &amp; RF playground: setup notes, scripts, configs, and experiments for running software-defined radio workflows on a Pi 5.
Raspberry Pi 5 SDR & RF Toolkit

This repository is a practical collection of setup notes, scripts, configuration files, and experiments for running software-defined radio (SDR) and related RF workflows on a Raspberry Pi 5.

The goal is to keep things reproducible, maintainable, and easy to operate on a headless/remote Pi, including:

System setup & dependencies (packages, drivers, permissions, performance tuning)

Device handling (USB devices, udev rules, service start/stop, recovery steps)

Automation & operations (shell scripts, logging, health checks, optional systemd units)

Networking & remote usage (SSH workflows, file transfers, remote control patterns)

Troubleshooting notes (common pitfalls, fixes, and “what actually worked”)

Security note: before publishing publicly, review content for sensitive details (usernames, hostnames, IPs, tokens/keys) and sanitize as needed.

What this repo is / isn’t

Is: a curated toolbox and documentation of a real-world Pi 5 SDR environment.

Isn’t: a single “one-click” installer or a fully supported distribution.

Wenn du willst, mach ich dir auch noch eine ultrakurze tagline (max 80 Zeichen) + Topics/Tags für GitHub.
